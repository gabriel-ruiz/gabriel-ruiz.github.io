## Welcome to my website!


I am Neyman Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics at University of California, Berkeley](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/).  Before that, I earned a  Ph.D. in statistics at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://stat.utexas.edu/) in May 2017 under the supervision of  [Prof. James Scott](http://jgscott.github.io/). Prior to that, I completed a B.S in Mathematics at [CIMAT](https://www.cimat.mx/en) in April 2013 advised by [Prof. Daniel Hernandez-Hernandez](https://www.cimat.mx/~dher/). 

A copy of my CV  can be found [here](https://github.com/hernanmp/hernanmp.github.io/blob/master/cv_oscar_madrid.pdf).
