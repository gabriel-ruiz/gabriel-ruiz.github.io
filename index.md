I am a PhD student in statistics at UCLA doing algorithmic and theoretical work on graphical models, including causal discovery and causal inference, with motivations that include bioinformatics and slight gaps in asymptotic statistical theory. Other areas of interest include data mining, change point detection, models for network and relational data, and generally the intersection of machine learning and statistics. My awesome advisors are [Qing Zhou](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~zhou/) and [Oscar Madrid Padilla](https://hernanmp.github.io/).

I received my B.S. in statistics from University of Calfornia, Riverside in 2017 and had the pleasure of working there with [Dr. Subir Ghosh](https://profiles.ucr.edu/subir.ghosh) through the [MARC U program](https://marcu.ucr.edu/). A copy of my resum√© can be found [here](https://github.com/gabriel-ruiz/gabriel-ruiz.github.io/blob/master/resume_ruizgabriel_github.pdf).

### Preprints
Forthcoming (hopefully this year): some work on causal discovery, causal inference. 

### Teaching
I have been a Teaching Assistant for Statistics 10-Introductory Statistics, [Statistics 100A-Probability with Texas Hold 'Em Examples](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~frederic/100a/W15/syllabus.html), and [Statistics 200C-High Dimensional Statistics](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~arashamini/teaching/200c).


### Some Other Experiences
I had the pleasure of working for [Dmitri Zaykin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Lk0u83MAAAAJ&hl=en) at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina in Summer 2016. And in Summer 2017 I worked at [Draper Laboratory](https://www.draper.com/) in Cambridge, MA with the Perception and Localization group thanks to the [GEM Consortium Fellowship](http://www.gemfellowship.org/students/gem-fellowship-program/). As an undergrad, I was also involved with the [Highlander Statistics Society](https://highlanderlink.ucr.edu/organization/hiss), a student chapter of the American Statistical Association.
